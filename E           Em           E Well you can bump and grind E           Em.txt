E           Em           E
Well you can bump and grind
E           Em           E
It's good for your mind
E           Em           E
Well, you can twist and shout,
E
Let it all hang out

(Chorus 1)

G           C                         A
But you won't move the children of the revolution
G           C                         A
No you won't move the children of the revolution, no, no!

(Verse 2)

E          Em        E
Well, you can tear a plane, in the falling rain
E          Em        E
I drive a rolls Royce, cuz it's good for my voice

(Chorus 2)

E          Em        E
But you won't move the children of the revolution
E          Em        E
No you won't move the children of the revolution, no, no!

Then, the chorus repeats twice, with the same lyrics and the chord progression of chorus 1.

(End)

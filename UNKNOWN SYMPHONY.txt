THE RAIN ON HER PLAIN

TELLS ME ALL ABOUT HER PAIN

THE STRAIN ON HER FACE

SHOW'S ME SHE'S PLAYING AT A GAME

I TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO HER ONE DAY

THAT IN THE END NOTHING IS GAINED

BUT SHE'S STILL DOING IT ANY FUCKING WAY

STILL THINKING LIFE IS A STAGE ACT

AND WE'RE ALL PART OF THIS STAGE ACT

FUCK ACTING IN A STAGE ACT

You've heard THAT

THE WISE WILL SAY

NEVER RUSH IN

OR EVER REACT

JUST BREATHE AND TAKE 2 STEPS BCK

SIZE UP WHAT WHAT YOU SEE

AND WHAT YOU GOT

THEN GET BEHIND THE STARTERS BLOCKS

AND TAKE YOUR TIME

SENSE THAT TIME MAY BE ALL WE'VE GOT

THOU IT PASSES IN A GLIMPSE

just LIKE GRAINS OF SAND

SLIPPING THROUGH OUR HANDS


REMINISCING ABOUT THE PAST

IS NOT SO WRONG

EACH BATTLE THAT WE'VE LOST

IS THERE TO MAKE US STRONG


SO,

TAKE A STONE

PICK IT UP

JOURNEY OUT TO THE RIVER

THEN TOSS IT OUT

LOOK AT THE RIPPLES IT WILL CAUSE,

ECHOES OF OUR SOULS

COMING BCK HOME

THOU YOU'LL NEVER SEE THAT STONE AGAIN

AS IT DROPS LIKE A DEAD WEIGHT

DOWN TOWARDS THE OCEAN FLOOR

SUCH IS LIFE, AS IN OUR DREAMS

VIBRANT AND SYMBOLIC

EASILY FORGOTTEN


WHAT I'M TRYING TO CONVEY TO HER

I'M REALLY NOT SURE

A STONE CAN CAUSE BEAUTIFUL RIPPLES

AND IT CAN KILL

THOUGHTS

 KEEP ON BEING THOUGHT

NO WORRIES

TELL THAT TO THE LOST

NO WORDS

TELL THAT TO THE DUMB

NO VIOLENCE

TELL THAT TO THE VICTIMS

NO LOVE

TELL THAT TO THE FORSAKEN


BELIEF KEEPS US ALL GOING

FAITH KEEPS US ALL STRONG

MAYBE THERE'S NO GOD

BUT TRY LIVING AS IF YOU'RE ONE

OF HIS CHILDREN


LIGHTS CAN SHINE

EVEN ON THE EVIL

ROAD'S MAY ALWAYS WIND

TO THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO FIND

CYCLES MAY JUST REPEAT

TO THOSE ON THE GRIND


MAYBE YES

MAYBE NO

MAYBE YOU ARE NEVER SHOWN

WHICH WAY TO GO


AHHH

WHAT IS THIS ABOUT

THIS STRANGE LIFE WE LIVE

IS IT ABOUT LIVING

IS IT ABOUT FORGIVING

IS IT ALL COME TO FRUSTRATING ENDINGS


ALL I CAN SAY

IS THAT TIME TO TAKE IT SLOW

IT'S NOW OR EVER

IF I LEAVE

WILL YOU GO

IS O STAY

CAN TOU SEE ME


POURING MY SOUL OUT

IS SO FUCKING EASY

AS I AM STRANDED OUTSIDE

WITH NOWHERE TO HIDE

BUT I CANNOT LIE OR TURN

MY MIND FROM WHAT'S INSIDE

I NEVER HEAR YOUR WORDS

I NEVER PERCEIVE YOUR HURT

NEVER RUN

NEVER RUSH

THIS SEEMS TO BE ABSURD WORDS

THOU I KNOW

IN MAKE SO MUCH SENSE

IN FROM THE VOID


IN THE DARKNESS

I CAN HEAR THE VOICE

NO TYPE OF NOISE

WHERE I ENQUIRED ABOUT THE HEAVENS AND THE ANGELES

AND THE DEVILS

ITS SO UNREAL

THIS REALITY IS 10,000 MILLION

MINUTES

TIME IS A DOT

THOUGH INFINITY GOES ON

FOR EVER AND ON

THE ROAD TO NOWHERE

IS WHERE WE BELONG

EVERYONE IS NO-ONE

YOU ARE THE REASON

BEHIND MY SUFFERING

PRAISE YOU

HERE WE
HERE WE
HERE WE 
FUCKING GO

OOH OOOH
OOOHHHH

I WAS JUST OUT ONE DAY
TRYING TO MAKE MY WAY
THEN I GOT LOST
OUT ON THE HIGHWAY

AS I WAS BURLING
THROUGH THOSE FROZEN STREETS
I FOUND OUT


SO WHEN THE DARKNESS FALLS
I GO OUT BY MYSELF
I HEAD TO THE EDGE OF TOWN
THEN I LOOK AROUND

THEN ONE DAY
I REALISED 
WHAT I HAD
TO DO

HAD TO GET DOWN ON ONE KNEE
AND PRAISE YOU
PRAISE YOU
PRAISE YOU
PRAISE YOU
PRAISE YOU

SO I REALISE NOW
ITS NOT ALL ABOUT ME

I REALISE NOW
THINGS ARE SO EASY

I REALISE QUITE LATE
ITS FOR YOU

I REALISE

I HAVE TO
PRAISE YOU
HAVE TO 
PRAISE YOU
HAVE 2 PRAAISE YOU

I WAS JUST A YOUNG BOY
AND I JUST PLAYED WITH MY TOYS
I JUST SAT ON MY WALL
NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT
THOUGHT ABOUT MUCH AT ALL

THEN I GREW UP
FUCKED THINGS UP
BUT NOW IVE GOT A CHANCE
TO BRING IT BCK

SO MAYBE
ONE DAY YOU
SO MAYBE

MAYBE 
ONE DAY
YOU'LL COME SAVE ME

MAYBE
ONE DAY
YOU'LL BRING ME HOME

YOU KNOW WHAT

LATELY
I'VE BEEN DREAMING OF
DREAMING OF YOU
BABY
BEEN DREAMING
WE'RE ALL ALONE

BUT
I CANT BE HOLDING ON
HOLDING ON
WHEN THERE'S NOTHING
GOING ON

Remember a time
Before the lies
Remember the sparks
In the eyes
Remember that wearing a mask
Was just for the youth
Only on all hallows eve
Just to make the teens scream
Whilst munching on sweets
Watching the movie screens
Remember when adults
Had their own mind's
When it was child's play
To WONDER WHY
Whether we would ever die
Have so much fun
Just being outside
Before the madness and isolation
Set in
Truly its a pure heart sin
To see what we're becoming
Believing in the ridiculous
DANCE and MASQUERADE

SCREAM IF U WANT TO GO FASTER
JUST PAY US A LITTLE MORE GOLD
SO THE RIDE WILL CONTINUE ON AND ON
WHAT IS UP MUST COME DOWN
CAN U HANDLE THE DANGER
OF THE HELTER SKELTER
WHEN U GET OFF
THE DIZZINESS AND SICKNESS
MAY MAKE YOU STUMBLE
AROUND AND AROUND
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS
U CAN'T REGAIN CONTROL

IT'S SO TRUE
THAT THEIR REMAINS ONLY
BUT A FEW
WHO ARE NOT JUST PASSING THRU
PLANTED THEIR FLAG
AND MAKING A STAND
WILLING TO BE CRUCIFIED
IF THAT'S WHAT'S REQUIRED
ONLY DESPISE THE PITYING
MASSES OF MOTHER'S AND FATHER'S
WHO LOOK TO THE STATE
TO PAY THEM FOR DOING NOTHING
EXCEPT FAILING THE CHILDREN
WHO ARE WANTING FOR EVERYTHING
WHEN ALL THEY NEED IS A LITTLE ATTENTION

SO CONFUSING
THIS RITUAL OF YOU
WITH YOUR TELLY'S HANGING ON 
THE WALLS
TUNING IN
WHILST TUNING OUT
FROM RESPONSIBLE
TROUBLE STOPS AT MY FRONT DOOR
U ARE AFRAID AND PETRIFIED
 BAMBOOZLED WITH THE HYPNOTIC LIES
TAKING THE VACCINES
CAUSE THE NEWSCASTER TOLD YOU SO
JUST KEEP OBEYING
AND CONSENTING
IF YOU ONLY COMPLY
YOU MAY NOT NEED TO HAVE TO DIE
STAY INSIDE
THERE IS ALWAYS ANOTHER MOVIE ON
CONTINUE YOUR PROGRAMME
WE HAVE YOUR MIND
UNDER CONTROL

STOP!!!!!!
BEFORE WE GET FAR TOO OLD
TAKE THAT PROPAGANDA MACHINE
OFF THE Wall
EVEN SMASH IT WITH YOUR HAMMER DRILL
SIT ON YOUR WINDOW SILL
LOOK OUTSIDE
AND REMEMBER WHATS LIFE BUT LIFE
PLAY IN YOUR GARDEN
AND WORK HARD 
TO BEGIN TOMORROW MORNING
SMILING AS THE SUN IS DAWNING

OH 
LET YOURSELF LAY DOWN
AND REST IT WEARY HEAD
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T
HAVE TO FROWN
UNLESS YOU FEAR
WHAT I'VE SAID

OH
YOUR TIME IS NOW
YOU KNOW WHERE TO GO
OH WHAT U GONNA DO NOW
YOU GONNA GO
WITH THE FLOW

YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE FOUND
ITS TIME TO RAISE YOUR MIND
LET YOURSELF COME DOWN
AND SLEEP TONIGHT

Let's BE THE ONES
WHO DO
WHAT WE'VE 2 DO

YOU KNOW I CAN'T DAY NO MORE
NOW ITS DOWN 2 U

OH OHHH POO
OHH OHHH OOH

OHH 
COME AROUND
AND FEEL TONIGHT
DON'T FEAR WHAT THEY TRY TO SAY
JUST BE YOURSELF TONIGHT

On What Do You Do
When You're Out Of View
When You Feel 
No-one Can See You

What Do You Say
If You've Lost Your Way
And It Feels As If
Nothings Going Your Way

Well ALL I CAN TRY to Tell
Is Never Tell anybody a Tall Tale
Just Try To Be Yourself
And We Will Head Out
It's Tim To Head Out

Chorus
YOUR DREAMS ARE COMING REAL
YOUR DREAMS ARE ONLY
YOURS TO STEAL
IN YOUR WORLD
YOU SHINE SO BRIGHT
FOREVER IN MINE'S IT'S ALRIGHT

Verse
When You're light has home out
And It doesn't SHINE
When you FEEL like the Darkness
Is ALL you've got
YOUR candle burns so low
Seems it's going out
So if I could come around
You know what I'd do
Light the Candle for you

Chorus
CAUSE YOUR DREAMS SHINE SO BRIGHT
THEY SHINE FOR ME EVERY NIGHT
SO UNDERSTAND THAT
I'M ONLY A MAN
Even if you Forget TONIGHT

VERSE
SO WHAT CAN YOU BE
IF YOUR ON YOUR OWN
KNOW THAT I WILL ALWAYS
GET YOU HOME
I MAY NOT BE AROUND
BUT NEVER TOO FAR
I'll ROAD YOU A ROPE
BURN YOUR CANDLE
LOW

CHORUS
SHINE THROUGH FOR TONIGHT
SHINE ON TONIGHT
SHINE on Tonight
So BRIGHT

Refrain
Don't lose yourself
Your the only one who's there
Ross your prayers out to SEA

CAUSE YOUR DREAMS
ARE STILL REAL

I'VE BEEN HERE
FOR SUCH A LONG TIME
I'VE BEEN HERE
ALL THE TIME
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SHINE A LIGHT
NOW I'VE GOT A ONE WAY TICKET
OUT OF HERE
CAUSE YOU SEEM TO WANNA FACE MY FEARS
I MAY NOT ALWAYS BE HERE

OOOHH

WHO WILL LUV YA
WHO WILL LUV YA
WHEN I'M GONE
WHO WILL LUV YA
WHO WILL LUV YA
WHEN I'M GONE


I MIGHT NOT STAY
AROUND NO MORE
I MAY NOT ALWAYS
BE AT THE DOOR
I MAY NOT RUN AWAY
BUT I JUST CAN'T STAY
IN THIS SHITTY TOWN
I JUST CAN'T STAY AROUND ABOUT
I JUST CAN'T KEEP GIVING IT ALL AWAY

OOOHHH

WHO WILL LUV YA
WHO WILL LUV YA
WHEN I'M GONE
WHO WILL LUV YA
WHO WILL LUV YA
WHEN I'M GONE

WHO WILL LUV YA
WHO WILL LUV YA
WHEN I'M GONE
WHO WILL LUV YA
WHO WILL LUV YA
WHEN I'M GONE

WHO WILL LUV YA
WHO WILL LUV YA
WHEN I'M GONE
WHO WILL LUV YA
WHO WILL LUV YA
WHEN I'M GONE

WHO WILL LUV YA

WHO WILL LUV YA

WHO WILL LUV YA
WHEN I'M GONE

WHO WILL LUV YA
WHEN I'M GONE

WHO WILL LUV YA
WHEN I'M GONE

I Need the Lord
For my Troubled Mind
I Need the Lord
For my Troubled HEART ❤

I Need the Lord
To stay with me Tonight
I Need the Lord
To show me Whats RIGHT

I sometimes sit reminisce
If the good old days
The Times when I was young
And the WORLD 
Seemed so much fun
Times when it was ok to get fucked
A time when it was ok to get drunk
A time when the world seemed sowed up
A time it was ok to act the goat
Be a wee bit potty
A WEE bit insane
When I was only playing my own game
Never broke any rules
Never caused anyone any pain
Never knew what was to come
What was just around the corner
What the outside world had planned for me
How deep into Despair
I would have to travel
Have to sink
To finally call out the Lord's NAME

I Need the Lord
For my Troubled Mind
NEED the Lord 
For my Troubled HEART ❤,

Need the Lord
To show me his ways
Need the Lord
To make my road  Straight

Oh to live is to Die
To laugh is to cry
To dream is to see
Perceive nothing is as it seems
Listening to the HEART
The HEART matters more
Silence is the place to go
Where your sure to KNOW
What you know you know
Sail your mind
YOUR SACRED SPIRIT
And soul
Down the river stream
FOREVER going with the flow
Submit to the tide
The undertow is to strong
Find the shelter from the storm
Never GIVE in
Find rest in him
Easy as 1,2,3
Breathe  ~Trust ~3,6,9

OH IT'S SUCH A CRAXY SITUATION
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND YOUR OWN MIND
THEN SUDDENLY LIKE A BEAUTIFUL MYSTICAL EQUATION
YOU BEGIN 2 REALISE
HOW STRONG YOU ARE
HOW FAR YOU'VE CAME
HOW MUCH YOUR WORTH

SHINE ON
TONIGHT
SHINE ON
MY INDIGO CHILD

ONCE UPON NOT LONG AGO
YOU APPEARED TO ACT INSANE
ATTEMPTING TO PLAY THE WORLD'S GAME
NEVER AGAIN
IT'S YOUR TIME NOW
NOTHING YOU CANNOT DO
NOTHING CAN EVER STOP YOU

SHINE ON
EVER MORE
SHINE ON
MY INDIGO CHILD
MY INDIGO CHILD

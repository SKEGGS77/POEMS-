LOOKING BACK OVER LIFE
WONDERING WHAT IT IS I'LL FIND
WITCH WAY 2 GO
FEELING DOWN
LOOKING AROUND
WONDERING WHAT IT IS
I'VE FOUND
WITCH WAY 2 GO

I KNOW
WITCH WAY 2 GO

SHE TOOK MY KEYS
TOOK MY SOUL
TOOK HEART
TORE THEM APART
TOLD ME
WITCH WAY 2 GO

WITCH WAY 2 GO

WAS IT ALL PART OF A PLAN
OR COINCIDENCE
SO SHE COULD GET A BETTER MAN
I DON'T REALLY KNOW

WITCH WAY 2 GO

WITCH WAY 2 GO

SO I'M LYING HERE
ON THIS HOSPITAL BED
WITH THE BRAIN'S RUNNING THRU MY HEAD
DON'T WANT TO GO OUTSIDE 
TO HIDE FROM MY OWN MIND
I WANT TO SLEEP TONIGHT
I WANT TO GET ON BUS

FIND OUT
WITCH WAY 2 GO

WITCH WAY 2 GO

IS THE END OF MY TALE
STAY TUNED IN EVERY NIGHT
TO FIND OUT
WITCH WAY 2 GO

THE WORD IS LORD
THE LORD IS GOD
GOD IS LOVE
SHOWING US
WITCH WAY 2 GO

WITCH WAY 2 GO

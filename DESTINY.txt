Heading out into the storm
Through the windy streets
Bravo ECHOES CALLS
VIBRANT COLOURS WAVELENGTHS
TUNED INTO THE SOUL-STATION
CAN'T STOP ME NOW
SENDING THE SYNERGY
GRASPING THE ENERGY
SEIZING THE ETERNAL INFINITE MOMENT
ZERO SECONDS TILL DESTINY

THE DREAMS THAT DREAMT
ONCE SLEPT, TODAY ALIVE
ARISE OH MY SWEET SON
YOUR BROTHERS HAVE WIN
FOREVER YOUR SACRED SISTERS
ARE IN LOVE

OUR TIME IS NOW
STRONG WARRIORS 
FOLLOW THE SIGNS
RADIO'S HEARD HEARTS

DESTINY NOVA AEONS

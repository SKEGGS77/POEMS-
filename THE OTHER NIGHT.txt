An old Friend
Came to me
Just the other night
While I was awake
Inside a Dream

He didn't stay long
A word was never spoken
Now I don't think
I'll see him again
Thou my soul Yearns
FOR him once MORE

Now I've landed
Back where I BELONG
Lifted above
This small world
Below the underground
Higher than the rain CLOUDS

IT'S time now
My friend is watching down
KNOW I can win

He CAME THE OTHER NIGHT
THE OTHER.NET
AWAKENED BY A DREAM
JUST THE OTHER NIGHT
JUST THE OTHER NIGHT
OH NIGHT
NIGHT
NIGHT
OOHHH
Night

HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN A ROOM
FULL OF PEOPLE WHO YOU LOVE
FEELING LIKE THEY DON'T SEE YOU
THOU YOUR BACK HOME ONCE MORE

REFLECTING YOUR INNER PASSIONS
INDIFFERENCE MIRRORING STATIC EMOTIONS
FEELINGS YOU KEEP REPRESSED
EXPRESSED BY THE PERFORMANCES

ARTISTIC MELANCHOLIC DREAMERS
TELLING TALES, SETTING SAIL
POETIC CONTEMPLATING 'S MAKING YOU
FAMILIAR AMONGST STRANGERS

VOICES SO DISTANT, THOU CLEAR
SUCH IS IS LIFE, JUST LIKE THIS
FORGOT YOUR SELF, GLIMPSE INTO BLISS
IGNITE YOUR SACRED SPIRIT
FLOWING LIKE A RIVER
WE'RE ALL SLEEPING AWAKE TONIGHT

TIME TO ARISE SWEET WARRIORS
OUR CHILDREN NEED IS NOW
STOP HIDING YOUR SONGS AWAY
BRING THEN OUT TODAY
INTO THE WARM SUN
WHERE YOU BELONG
DEAR OLD FRIENDS
Back home  ONCE Again

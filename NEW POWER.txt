I was BLIND AND DUMB
BEFOORRREE
WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND AFRAID
LIKE MANY
WHO'VE WENT DOWN
THAT SAME OLD ROAD

I TRIED AND STRIVED n LIED
THINKING I KNEW THE SCORE
UnasSUMING AND PRESUMING
THAT I KNEW WHAT LOVE WAS
AND WHAT IT REALLY IS ABOUT

THOUGHT I HAD IT ALL
THOUGH NEVER HAD MUCH AT ALL
WATCHING MY SAND DUNES EMPIRE
JUST CRUMBLE AND FALL
NEVER REALLY HAD AN EYE ON THE BALL
FEVER PITCH,  FORTUNE, NEVER SAW 
EYES WEREN'T ON THE PRIZE

THEN LIKE A BEAUTIFUL TWILIGHT STORM
SUOUND OF hail ~STONES
BELTING OFF THE WINDOW FRAME
PATTERN OF VIBRANT COLOURS, RAINBOWS
PRISMS AND SPECTRUMS
GLIMPSES OF NEW BORN WEANS
BORN TO LIVE

I SAW
I SEEN
I KNEW
I KNOW

WHAT IS A MAN WORTH TO HIMSELF
AS HE LOOKS INTO THE RIVERS STREAMS
CAN HE LIVE ANOTHER'S DREAMS
OR BE WHO HE'S NOT
WHAT HAS HE GOT
RATHER WHAT'S HE TO LOSE
BY FALLING IN LOVE 
WITH HIMSELF
BESOTTED BY HIS CRAZY MYSTICAL EXPERIENCE
REFLECTING THE ONLY TRUTHFUL FRIEND
HE KNOWS

One LOVE
ONE SHOT
MAYBE AYE
MAYBE NOT
FCK KARMIC DEBT
AND ALL THE GOSSIPS
WAFFLING OBFUSCATION
ABOUTS RESURRECTION
NO TIME FOR HEARING ABOUT INSERRUCTIONS

PONDERING WONDERING
WANDERING WINKING ðŸ˜‰
AND WALKING ON 
HEAD IN THE CLOUDS
THOU ONE FOOT(AT LEAST)
FIRMLY ON THE GROUND

TALKING OF SPEAKING TO 
ALL WHO WILL HEAR
HEART IS SO FUCKING PURE
NOT A LUCKY MAN
OR FORTUNATE
JUST GALLUS
TOUGH AS NAILS
BRIGHTER THAN BLACKPOOL PIER

SPARKY WAS HIS LIFE
HOW BILL 'SHELL '
LORD OF THE DANCE
KING FOR HIMSELF

DON'T TRY TO STOP ME
HOW
IT'S SUCH A LOVELY TIME
AT MY PARTY
SO FAR
IT'S ONLY ME, MYSELF AND THE WEE BIT CHEIF

BUT DOOR, EARS AND INVITE
IS OUT FOR ANYONE WHO
FEELS THEY CAN HANDLE
HIS TRUTH

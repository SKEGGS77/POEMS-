IVE GOT HEART
I'VE GOT SOUL

A TEAR IN MY EYE'S

A SMILE FOR YOU
AND A WINK

IF YOUR EYES OFF THE PRIZE

AXE'S ARE NEVER TO GRIND
JUST TO CUT THROUGH THE ROUGH
BREAK THE ROCK
AS I HEAD TO.THE MOUNTAIN TOP

AIMING MY TORPEDOES TO BLOW 
UP THE HOWLING MOON
GOING TO SMACK THAT BLACK CUBE
RIGHT INTO THE SUN
WIN-WIN 
I AM WILL2 WIN

CAN'T STOP ME NO
THE BATTLEFIELD IS QLIVE AGAIN
WITH THE BEAUTIFUL
ROSES AND THISTLE S SHINE THROUGH
JUST GET TAE FCK
If you see me
I YOU KNOW THAT SOME TIMES A BITCH SLAP
IS NECCESAAY

IF IT CAME DOWN
TO THE WIRE
TO THE BRINK
TO BREAK INTO THE PRISON
SET THE CAPTIVES FREE
SEE JUSTICE 4 THE INNOCENT
RELEASE THE PROPHETS
REJUVENATING THE SPIRITUAL DREAMS
CLEANSE the HOLY RIVERS
AND BRING PEACE TO THIS INCARNATION

WHAT WOULD YOU DO
TAKE THE SHOT

WELL HERES HOW

THERE'S NO TIME
LIKE THEZE TIMES
THE PRESENT AND PRESENCE
GIFTED FROM ABOVE
SENTINEL SENTIANTS
NOT SENTIMENTAL VICTIMS
AROSE HEART'S FELT WARRIORS
LOVERS AND POETS
BUILDERS, MOTHER'S SISTER'S
BROTHERS, AND ALL OTHER'S
WHOM HEAR THE CALL
SENSE THE SYNERGY
HARNESS THE ENERGY
LET'S DO THIS

ONE SHOT
ALL WE GOT
ONE SHOT
ALL WE HAVE
ONE SHOT

SOME WILL SAY
NO CHANCE
SOME WILL
RUN FAST
SOME WILL SWAY
TO THE FEAR
THO MAYBE ME, YOU AND EVEN ANOTHER 2
AH YOU NEVER KNOW
EVEN ANOTHER 4
THEN PERHAPS A LOT MORE
CAN CRASH THRU THE WALL'S
BREAK DOWN THE DOORS
Smash THRU the gates
That ENCOURAGES THE HATE
SPITE
VIOLENCE
ABUSE
RIDICULE
KILLING and POVERTY
FUCK THE COURTS
FCK THE HOSTELS
AND FCK THE COPS

SO
ONE SHOT
IS WHAT WE GOT
IS ALL WE NEED

NO GETTING AWAY WITH STEALING
NO GETTING AWAY WITH THIEVING
NO CARDBOARD WANGSTAS
NO ORDER FOLLOWERS
NO AUTHORITIES
OTHER THAN GOD
AND THOU SElf

THE mantras GO LIKE THIS
STRONG
CARE FOR THE WEAK
RICH 
FINANCE THE POOR
HEALTHY 
AID The
InFIRM
INTELLIGENT
TEACH THE DUMB

ONE SHOT
ONE SHOT
THIS SHOT
IS ALL WE GOT
ALL WE HAVE
ONE FYCKING SHOT

GOD GRANT ME THE SERENITY TO ACCEPT THE THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE
THE COURAGE TO CHANGE THE THINGS I CAN
AND THE WISDOM TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

MAYBE WE ONLY GET ONE SHOT
TO SHINE ON
ONLY ONE GO
TO TRULY LET GO
ONE MOMENT TO SHOUT OUT
WIN OR LOSE ALL WE'VE GOT

CRASH THRU THE WALLS
BREAK DOWN THE DOORS
RATTLE THE CAVES
LET THE WORLD SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT

NO MATTER WHAT YOU'VE GOT
NO MATTER WHAT YOUR NOT
NO MATTER WHAT YOU'VE LOST
WILL YOU DO WHAT YOU SHOULD

NO MATTER WHAT YOU'VE SEEM
NO MATTER WHERE YOU'VE BEEN
NO MATTER WHAT YOU'VE BELIEVED
WILL YOU TAKE YOUR CHANCE

ONE SHOT TO GRAB IT ALL
WILL YOU TAKE THE RISK
OR LOSE IT ALL
